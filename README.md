# Wine Quality Analysis and Prediction 
This project involves analysing a wine dataset to understand the characteristics that influence wine quality and developing machine learning models to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties.

## About the Data
The project uses the `wine.csv` dataset, which contains information about different types of wines and their quality ratings. The 'quality' column is the target variable.

## Analysis
The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset. This includes:
- Checking descriptive statistics.
- Exploring correlations between features like fixed acidity, alcohol, and sulfur dioxide with wine quality.
- Visualizing relationships between features and quality using scatter plots.
- Analyzing the average residual sugar for the highest and lowest quality wines.

## Modeling
Two machine learning models are implemented to predict wine quality:
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab notebook.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
4. Make sure the `wine.csv` dataset is in the correct path or uploaded to your environment.
5. Run the cells in the notebook.
